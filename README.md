Windows Tip 2
> If you're using Docker for Windows, Then simply start the desktop app installed in C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe
> You can also stop Docker for Windows and run just the Docker daemon dockerd.exe. That'll only let you run Docker Windows Containers. dockerd.exe is in the program files directory.
